# Keiko Akagi, PhD
**Cancer Genomics | Long-Read Sequencing | AI-Curious Bioinformatician**

I build practical tools at the intersection of **cancer genomics**, **long-read sequencing**, and **virus-induced genomic alteration**

Current focus: robust detection and interpretation of **HPV integration** and **structural variants** in tumors.
I·m also exploring **AI-assisted** scoring and visualization of complex rearrangements.
