# Keiko Akagi, PhD
**Cancer Genomics | Long-Read Sequencing | Bioinformatics**

I build practical tools at the intersection of **cancer genomics**, **long-read sequencing**, and **virus-induced genomic alteration**

Current focus: robust detection and interpretation of **HPV integration** and **structural variants** in tumors.
I'm also exploring **AI-assisted** scoring and visualization of complex rearrangements.

## Â· About Me
- Interests: long-read (ONT/PacBio), structural variants, virus integration, single-cell/spatial, TCR-seq
- Tooling: Python, R, Snakemake
- Advocate for open science and reproducible research

---
## Â· Featured Repositories
- **[virus-integration-pipeline](https://github.mdanderson.org/kakagi/virus-integration-pipeline)**
Utilities for long-read analysis: chimeric read detection & SVÂ·BED conversion (MVP).
- *(Coming Soon)* **virus-host-concatemer-resolver**
Resolve & visualize complex virusÂ·host concatemers from long-reads.
